SecureNotesApp

My first project, everything was ugly and it still now. The idea was making a todo note app, but instead of just saving content, the app would encrypt it using Base-64. User would need to authenticate themselves via password in order to be able to decrypt.

Future TODO : 
- change database into SQLite instead of Firebase Realtime Database
- implement MVP design pattern.

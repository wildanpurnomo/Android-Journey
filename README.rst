My second project for certain Hackathon. We didn't win but our app made into top 10 ideas
and we got travel cost reimbursement. The idea was through this app, people,
specifically Indonesian, could purchase Fuel (BBM). They would receive token upon
purchasing to be scanned or given to special filling machine. This 'special' filling 
machine would have no operator. 

Future TODO :
- implement MVP design pattern
